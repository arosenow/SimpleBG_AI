Simple Baldurs Gate AI 1.0

I tend to play baldur's gate fairly hands on, directly controlling wizards and trying to constrain warriors to attacking those nearby. 

# Features of this AI:
Toggle being passive with V key, handy if you want them to just use their modal skills
Outside combat, always use skills, during combat if you're an archer, alternate skill use and attack
Don't do anything to break stealth
If an enemy is very close then attack
Remember if you told them to use melee or ranged weapons. Eg they'll use melee if they can, only using a bow if the enemy is far away, unless you told them to use bows in which case they will never change.
A positive consequence of this, if your mage runs out of darts they no longer run into combat unless someone is very close

Your party will act as a team, if one is in combat, others if skilled, will run to help, this means your archers will actually advance and attack enemies kiting you
