Simple Baldurs Gate AI 1.01

I tend to play baldur's gate fairly hands on, directly controlling wizards and trying to constrain warriors to attacking those nearby. 

# Features of this AI:

Toggle being passive with V key, handy if you only want them to use their modal skills. 

Outside combat, always use skills, during combat if you're an archer, alternate skill use and attack

Your party will act as a team, if one is in combat, others if skilled, will run to help, this means your archers will actually advance and attack enemies kiting you

Remember if you told them to use melee or ranged weapons. Eg they'll use melee if they can, only using a bow if the enemy is far away, unless you told them to use bows in which case they will never change.

A positive consequence of this, if your mage runs out of darts they no longer run into combat unless someone is very close

Don't do anything to break stealth

If an enemy is very close then attack or if you have a bow attack at range

#History
1.01 Fixed that the combat skill timer could break as it wasn't 3 seconds every 12, but 2 timers on different frequencies

1.02 Made the necessary adjustments for Icewind Dale 2. Sadly there's no way for AI to identify switches in the environment as opposed to enemies
